# ENGO-651-LAB-5

In this lab, you’ll learn about using Turf.js to add line simplification to your web mapping applications. You will be allowing a user to draw a polyline. And when a user clicks on a “simplify button”, the map will show a simplified version of the polyline drew by the user in a different color.
